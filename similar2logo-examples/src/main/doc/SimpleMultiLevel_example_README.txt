A simple multi-level model in which passive agents move from levels LOGO and LOGO2
when they arrive at the environment bounds.

Java implementation:
	The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'SimpleMultiLevelSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/simplemultilevel/src/java/fr/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/simplemultilevel' directory of the distribution.
	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.boids.SimpleMultiLevelSimulationMain
