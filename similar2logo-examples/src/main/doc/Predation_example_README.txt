A Logo simulation of the prey predator model. Preys eat grass and predators eat preys.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'RandomWalkPredationSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/predation/src/java/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/predation' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.univ_artois.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.predation.RandomWalkPredationSimulationMain
