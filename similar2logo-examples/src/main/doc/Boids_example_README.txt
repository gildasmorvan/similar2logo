A Logo simulation of the Boids model. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids for more information.

Java implementation:
	The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'BoidsSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/boids/src/java/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/boids' directory of the distribution.
	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		java -cp "lib/*" fr.univ_artois.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.boids.BoidsSimulationMain

Groovy implementation:
	The main Groovy script of this simulation model is defined in the 'GroovyBoidsSimulation.groovy' file, located in the 'examples/boids/src/groovy/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/boids' directory of the distribution.
	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		groovy -cp "lib/*" examples/boids/src/groovy/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/boids/GroovyBoidsSimulation

Python implementation
		The main Python script of this simulation model is defined in the 'BoidsSimulation.py' file, located in the 'examples/boids/src/python/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/boids' directory of the distribution.
		To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		jython  -J-cp "lib/*" examples/boids/src/python/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/boids/BoidsSimulation.py
				
Ruby implementation:
