A Logo simulation of trains. The trains go and back from the differents stations. Trains can go back if we choose to use one way.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'TrainSimulationMain.java' file, located in the '\similar2logo-examples\src\main\java\fr\lgi2a\similar2logo\examples\train' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory if the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.train.TrainSimulationMain
