A Logo simulation multiple Langtonâ€™s ants. The model is inspired by this paper: 
http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2010/pdf/01%20Full%20Papers/11_04_FP_0210.pdf

When conflicting influences (removing or dropping a mark to the same location) are detected,  a specific policy is applied:
- if the parameter dropMark is true, the dropping influence takes precedent over the removing one and reciprocally.
- if the parameter removeDirectionChange is true, direction changes are not taken into account.

Java implementatop,
	Two instances of the multi-turmite model are provided.
		- fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.multiturmite.TwoTurmitesSimulationMain defines a simple instance of the multi-turmite model with two turtles located at (x,y) and (x,y+1) and heading north. This simulation results in a growing squares. There are no collision in this simulation. Thus, parameters inverseMarkUpdate and removeDirectionChange have no effect.
		- fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.multiturmite.FourTurmitesSimulationMain defines an instance of the multi-turmite model with four turtles. This simulation results different cyclic or environment-filling behaviors according to the values of parameters inverseMarkUpdate and removeDirectionChange.

	To run this simulation, use either one of the following commands from the root directory of the distribution :
		java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.multiturmite.TwoTurmitesSimulationMain
		java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.multiturmite.FourTurmitesSimulationMain

Python implementation
		The main Python script of this simulation model is defined in the 'MultiTurmiteSimulation.py' file, located in the 'examples/multiturmite/src/python/fr/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/multiturmite' directory of the distribution.
		To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		jython  -J-cp "lib/*" examples/multiturmite turmite/src/python/fr/multiturmite turmite/examples/passive/MultiTurmiteSimulation.py
