A Logo simulation of the transmission of a virus in a population. The model is inspired by this one: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Virus.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'VirusSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/virus/src/java/fr/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/virus' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.virus.VirusSimulationMain
