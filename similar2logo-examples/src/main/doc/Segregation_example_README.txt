A Logo simulation of the famous Schelling's segregation model. See https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf for more information.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'SegregationSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/segregation/src/java/fr/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.segregation.SegregationSimulationMain
