A Logo simulation of the famous Schelling's segregation model. See https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf for more information.

Java implementation:
	The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'SegregationSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/segregation/src/java/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation' directory of the distribution.

	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
		java -cp "lib/*" fr.univ_artois.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.segregation.SegregationSimulationMain

Groovy implementation:
	The main Groovy script of this simulation model is defined in the 'GroovySegregationSimulation.groovy' file, located in the 'examples/segregation/src/groovy/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation' directory of the distribution.
	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		groovy -cp "lib/*" examples/segregation/src/groovy/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation/GroovySegregationSimulation

Python implementation
		The main Python script of this simulation model is defined in the 'SegregationSimulation.py' file, located in the 'examples/segregation/src/python/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation' directory of the distribution.
		To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		jython  -J-cp "lib/*" examples/segregation/src/python/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation/SegregationSimulation.py
		
Ruby implementation:
	The main Ruby script of this simulation model is defined in the 'RubySegregationSimulation.rb' file, located in the 'examples/segregation/src/ruby/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation' directory of the distribution.
	To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution:
		jruby -J-cp "lib/*"   examples/segregation/src/ruby/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/segregation/RubySegregationSimulation.rb
