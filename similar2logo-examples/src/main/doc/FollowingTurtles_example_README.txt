A Logo simulation with  a set of turtles that follow the closest perceived turtle and adapt their speed to it.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'PassiveTurtleSimulationMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/following/src/java/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/passive' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.univ_artois.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.passive.PassiveTurtleSimulationMain
