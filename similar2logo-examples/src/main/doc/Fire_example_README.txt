Simulation of forest fire. The model is inspired by this one: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Fire.

The main class of this simulation model is defined in the 'FireForestMain.java' file, located in the 'examples/fire/src/java/fr/univ_artois/lgi2a/similar2logo/examples/fire' directory of the distribution.

To run this simulation, use the following command from the root directory of the distribution :
	java -cp "lib/*" fr.univ_artois.lgi2a.similar2logo.examples.fire.FireForestSimulationMain
