 * The main class of the exploration of the predation model using the classical method 
 * (cf. J. Banks, J.S. Carson II, B.L. Nelson, and D.M. Nicol. Discrete-event system
 * simulation. Pearson, 5th edition, 2010.).
 * 
 * The model parameters have been tuned to produce 3 types of solutions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>preys and predators survive</li>
 * <li>preys survive and predators die</li>
 * <li>preys and predators die</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The simulations are executed 3600 times to be able to correctly estimate the mean values
 * of prey and predator populations as well as the quantity of grass in the environment.
 * 
 * The number of replications has been determined from a variance analysis performed on 150
 * initial replications:
